{"name":"Recommendation System with Item-Item Collaborative Filtering","tagline":"A recommender system prototype based on item-item collaborative filtering","body":"## Setup\r\n\r\nThe system is built with LensKit, an open-source took kit for building recommenders.\r\n\r\nRequires the following:\r\n\r\n[Java SE Development Kit 7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html/)\r\n\r\n[LensKit](http://lenskit.grouplens.org/)\r\n\r\n[Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)\r\n\r\nJava IDE such as [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) or [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nThis recommendation system prototype uses item-item collaborative filtering.  [Here for details.](http://files.grouplens.org/papers/www10_sarwar.pdf)\r\n\r\nThe algorithm is composed of the following steps.\r\n\r\n1. Building a model by computing similarities between items.  We do this by:\r\na. Subtract the user's mean rating from each rating prior to computing similarities.\r\nb. Calculate [cosine similarity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) between items.\r\n\r\n2. Score the items.  By using a pre-defined number of neighbours computed in step 1, the item is scored using [weighted sum](http://files.grouplens.org/papers/www10_sarwar.pdf).\r\n\r\n3. The item-item similarity matrix is also useful for 'find similar items' features.  Items can be scored with the sum of its similarity to each of their reference items.\r\n\r\n## Test Drive\r\n\r\nA set of test data is provided for movie ratings, but can be easily adopted for other domains.\r\n\r\ndata/movie-titles.csv\r\nMaps Movie IDs to Movie Titles.\r\n\r\ndata/ratings.csv\r\nUsers and their movie ratings. Each line of the CSV file is ordered as: User ID, Movie ID, Rating\r\n\r\ndata/users.csv\r\nMaps User ID to User Name.\r\n\r\nRun the recommender with command similar to the following:\r\nrun-ii 1024:77 1024:268 1024:462 1024:393 1024:36955 2048:77 2048:36955 2048:788\r\n\r\nFor each pair, the first item is the User ID and the second pair is the Movie ID.\r\n\r\nOutputs associate score for each move/user pair.  With the test dataset, the following result is obtained.\r\n2048,788,4.1253,Mrs. Doubtfire (1993)\r\n2048,36955,3.8545,True Lies (1994)\r\n2048,77,4.5102,Memento (2000)\r\n1024,462,2.9900,Erin Brockovich (2000)\r\n1024,393,3.7702,Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004)\r\n1024,36955,2.5612,True Lies (1994)\r\n1024,77,4.1968,Memento (2000)\r\n1024,268,2.3366,Batman (1989)\r\n\r\nFor running the 'find similar items' feature with reference item:\r\nrun-ii --basket 77\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n550,0.3192,Fight Club (1999)\r\n629,0.3078,The Usual Suspects (1995)\r\n38,0.2574,Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)\r\n278,0.2399,The Shawshank Redemption (1994)\r\n680,0.2394,Pulp Fiction (1994)\r\n\r\nCan also run with multiple reference items:\r\nrun-ii --basket 77 680\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n550,0.6941,Fight Club (1999)\r\n629,0.5984,The Usual Suspects (1995)\r\n238,0.5361,The Godfather (1972)\r\n278,0.5166,The Shawshank Redemption (1994)\r\n274,0.4916,The Silence of the Lambs (1991)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
